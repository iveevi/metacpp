# Metacpp

Meta C++ data structures, and other utilities for compile-time programming.
Requires C++20.

## Why?

Good question. Next.

On a more serious note; the C++ template system is Turing complete, which means
that one can theoretically perform arbitrary computations with it. However, this
is not at all practical (and probably will never be) as is. This library aims to
make this a bit easier for developers.

## What can you do with it?

... \*scribbling documentation\*

## How?

~~Abuse the compiler~~ Excessive template metaprogramming.

## Usage

Yoink `metacpp.hpp` and yeet into your project. Isn't that nice?

## Future steps

No.

OK, maybe:

- [ ] Compile-time construction of functions via composition
